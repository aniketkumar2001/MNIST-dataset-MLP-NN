# MNIST-dataset-MLP-NN
Training an MLP Neural Network for MNIST Dataset using only numpy and pandas


The dataset can be downloaded in CSV format from the following link: [MNIST Datasets](https://git-disl.github.io/GTDLBench/datasets/mnist_datasets/).
I implemented a neural network with two hidden layers, each consisting of 16 neurons. 
The ReLU activation function is used for the hidden layers, while the sigmoid activation function is applied to the output layer. <br>
The model achieved an accuracy of 86% on the test dataset, and the corresponding confusion matrix has been plotted to visualize the performance.
The weights and biases for the trained model have been saved in .npy format, named as W1, W2, W3, B1, B2, B3.
